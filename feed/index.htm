				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Virtual influencers are taking Instagram by storm, attracting millions of followers and landing huge deals with big brands. Lil Miquela and Shudu Gram are at the forefront of the trend and offer us a glimpse of how CGI may mean time out for human talent.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15738" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/virtual-influencers-cover.png" alt="Virtual Influencers" width="640" height="458" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/virtual-influencers-cover.png 640w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/virtual-influencers-cover-300x215.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
Image from the Lil Miquela Instagram account</p>
<p><strong>Lil Miquela</strong></p>
<p>Super secretive startup Brud posted the first image of Lil Miquela on Instagram in 2016. She now has 1.3 million followers and partnership deals with brands such as Prada and Nike. The difference between Lil Miquela and other “influencers” is that she’s not human, she’s a CGI.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15736" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/miquela.png" alt="miquela" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/miquela.png 640w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/miquela-300x202.png 300w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/miquela-600x403.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
Screenshot from the Lil Miquela Instagram account</p>
<p>Created by artists and designers, Lil Miquela is said to be a 19-year-old model and musician from LA. She also supports good causes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Black Lives Matter @innocenceproject | @lgbtlifecenter | @dwcweb | @justiceforyouth</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This new breed of hyperreal avatar is <a href="https://cgi.riverfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking CGI to a new level</a>. Some people are starting to connect with the characters as if they were real, describing them using words like sympathetic and emotional.</p>
<p>There are many examples of hyperrealism in the media and the arts, the work of sculptor Ron Mueck being just one of them. But they aren’t designed to mimic the role of a real person and be involved in society in quite the same way that Lil Miquela and others like her are. The lines between what is real and what is not are becoming more blurred, at least from the audience’s perspective. <em>“Why u look like a human doll?”</em> Asked one Instagram follower.</p>
<p>These CGIs are fulfilling commercial job roles and this raises some questions. How long before technology delivers to us the first hyperreal avatar film star? What will the legal and ethical issues be and what impact will they have on the human talent of the future?</p>
<p><strong>Shudu Gram</strong></p>
<p>Shudu Gram is the creation of fashion photographer Cameron-James Wilson and is being hailed, by some, as the first virtual supermodel. Shudu has already been made to move and although, at the moment, the movement is a little clunky, it’s clear that it won’t be long before this is refined. But, in order for Shudu’s movement to be indistinguishable from that of a humans, much work would be required.</p>
<p>Ryan Lok, CGI specialist here at River Film explains.</p>
<p><em>“At the moment Shudu’s animation looks unnatural, almost like an animatronic, which causes the character to fall into the “uncanny valley”. To take it to the next level, the creators would need to turn to motion capture.</em></p>
<p><em>Motion capture (Mocap) would allow them to capture movements that you normally don’t pay attention to. Often these movements are very minute. For example, when you smile not only do your cheeks rise, but you also have wrinkles around the edges of your eyes and nose.</em></p>
<p><em>Mocap is not a cheap technique though. Capturing/recording is just one of the elements, lots of other resources are required prior to and after the capturing. Such as a more complex rig, needed to enable more detailed animation. Mocap data requires a lot of clean up, the animation will often need to be refined by an animator &#8211; whilst the captured data is accurate, it sometimes doesn’t give you that realistic feel.</em></p>
<p><em>The technique has improved and developed a lot over recent years with films such as Avatar, Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes etc. And it will continue to get better, cheaper and faster.”</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15737" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shudu-virtual-influencer.png" alt="shudu virtual influencer" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shudu-virtual-influencer.png 640w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shudu-virtual-influencer-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
Image from the Shudu Gram Instagram account</p>
<p>Concerns have already been raised, however, regarding some of the legal and ethical implications of how virtual talent is used. Whilst commenting on Shudu, one Twitter user wrote:</p>
<p><em>“A white photographer figured out a way to profit off of black women without ever having to pay one.”</em></p>
<p>Indeed the potential advantages of using CGI characters are aplenty; they don’t charge a fee, they don’t complain and are never late. So for brands and others who may seek to use them they offer reliability, consistency and economy. But what they can’t offer are things like collaboration, improvisation, spontaneity and unpredictability – the very things that can often contribute to brilliance in human endeavour.</p>
<p>So, it may well be that virtual characters impose time outs on some of the more replaceable talent that’s out there, but they will never replace those whose talent is born of being inherently human.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Razor subscription company Dollar Shave Club have released two new TV commercials. Both feature the hallmarks that the company has become noted for, humour and an appearance from founder and CEO Michael Dubin. And both highlight the importance of the creative journey embarked upon to bring them to life.</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QEU-MAZRhJs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Get Ready</strong></p>
<p>Get Ready is a long-form video that celebrates diversity among men by showing them in various grooming scenarios. Some of the scenarios are a little risqué, Dubin’s character padding his underwear with toilet paper for example and this provides much of the humour.</p>
<p>We also see several other instances of men <em>getting ready</em>. One is attending to some of the more delicate areas of his body and another, a drag queen, is shaving his legs whilst giving grooming advice to a rather nerdy looking guy – there’s an endearing element of circus about the ad.</p>
<p>The humour is amplified as we hear the dulcet tones of Steve Lawrence singing “I’ve Gotta be Me” and this, along with strong performances from the actors, adds to the sense that the characters are completely unapologetic for their antics – no matter how weird they are.</p>
<p>The final shot shows the men, united and triumphantly walking together towards the camera – “Welcome to the club” reads the end title.</p>
<p><strong>Free Gift</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to Get Ready, Free Gift is 40 seconds long and uses slapstick to provide both the humour and to reinforce the ad’s message “<em>Tired of gettin beat up by high razor prices?</em>”</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LsPQFsPvMgM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Here we see the main character, in a store, paying more than he expected for his razors and then being given a punch in the balls for his troubles. This is his <em>free gift</em>. Comic timing and the deadpan delivery of the lines are instrumental, as is the quick-fire sell at the end of the ad – courtesy of Dubin.</p>
<p>The in-house creative team at Dollar Shave Club are responsible for both of these <a href="/all-films/branded-content-television-commercials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV commercials</a>. The company remain reluctant to outsource work to creative agencies despite being bought for $1 billion by Unilever in 2016. When asked about working in-house Dubin explained:</p>
<p><em>“It helps us infuse our brand tone and voice into all touch points the consumer sees and even some internal facing things that the consumer doesn’t see.”</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This in-house method of working, whilst great for Dollar Shave Club and a few others like them, is quite uncommon. The majority of companies prefer to outsource creative and production work, leaving them free to focus on their core business activities and remain in an arena where they are comfortable.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Our Blades Are F***ing Great</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZUG9qYTJMsI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The brand tone and voice in the company’s video commercials has been nothing if not consistent since its first offering in 2012. Our Blades Are F***ing Great, features Dubin throughout as he describes the advantages of his products and outlines the reasons for not overpaying for razors, “<em>stop paying for shave-tech you don’t need</em>”. The pace of this commercial is noteworthy, but it is perhaps Dubin’s performance and the more bizarre aspects of the piece that made it such a creative and commercial hit. The video has 25.5 million views on YouTube alone and on the day it was released Dollar Shave Club signed up 12,000 new subscribers.</p>
<p>Dubin insists that Dollar Shave Club is simply offering customers “<em>the best version of themselves</em>”, but bring into play an intrinsic understanding of what makes men tick and a little creative genius, then you really have a cutting-edge prospect.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The UK has become a focus for some of the worlds filmmaking elite. But it isn’t just top quality locations that attract film producers, there are financial incentives, outstanding technical talent to draw upon and some of the best production fixers on the planet. </b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15633 size-full" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fixing-cover-1.png" alt="" width="860" height="478" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fixing-cover-1.png 860w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fixing-cover-1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/fixing-cover-1-768x427.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<h2><b>What is Production Fixing?</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.riverfilm.com/production-fixers/">Production fixing</a> is simply the process of supporting companies who are looking to shoot on location, usually in unfamiliar territory. Typically, the work involves activities such as location scouting, equipment rental, planning travel arrangements and booking accommodation. The aim is to ensure that the clients have everything they need when they arrive on location, that the shoot runs to schedule and does so without any significant problems.</p>
<p>Whilst production fixing is nothing new the demand for ‘fixing’ is a good indication of the buoyancy we are seeing right across the British film industry. Figures published by the British Film Institute (BFI), indicate that in 2017 spend on film production reached £1.9 billion, up 12% on the previous year.</p>
<h3><b>The Top Film Locations in London</b></h3>
<p>It’ll come as no surprise that London is the most popular film location in the UK, with the South Bank and Canary Wharf ranked among the top 20 most-used locations in the world. As well as the high profile productions, Bond films for instance, there are hundreds of smaller productions being conceived and crafted in the country’s capital every day.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15636" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/london-panarama.jpeg" alt="London Panorama" width="860" height="320" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/london-panarama.jpeg 860w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/london-panarama-300x112.jpeg 300w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/london-panarama-768x286.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<p>In addition to London however, a great number of other UK locations are worthy of note. Liverpool, for example, sees its fair share of clapper boards, dollies and jibs and will also be the home to Twickenham Studios’ new base.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-15635 size-full" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/liverpool-location-2.png" alt="Photo of Liverpool" width="860" height="483" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/liverpool-location-2.png 860w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/liverpool-location-2-300x168.png 300w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/liverpool-location-2-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<p>The list goes on, but it is fair to say that for both entertainment and corporate productions, the rich tapestry of locations that the UK has to offer is remarkable – film producers and directors come here because they can find what they are looking for.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You can get to any kind of location quickly, so it brings down your budget for the film as your moving costs are down and you can shoot more in a day.&#8221;</em> Yugesh Walia</p>
<p>While UK locations may be relatively easy to get to, the logistics of doing so can still be considerable. This is why many companies look to experts for help and that’s where production fixers come into the equation.</p>
<p><strong>According to the BFI:</strong></p>
<p><em>“The strength of the UK’s production sector is rooted in international confidence in the excellence of UK crews, the quality of the UK’s state-of-the-art studios and facilities, our film-friendly locations, crews, support from the British Film Commission and the attractive fiscal environment created by the Government’s creative sector tax reliefs. This winning combination continues to cement the UK’s reputation as the global destination of choice for film and TV production.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>“Ready or not, here I come, you can’t hide.” This is filmmaking, product placement, celebrity endorsement and viral marketing done brilliantly!</b></p>
<p>If you wanted to promote a product, you could do far worse than to produce a short film that shamelessly features that product along with endorsements from some of the world’s biggest sporting names.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15620" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/harry-kane.jpeg" alt="Harry Kane" width="860" height="500" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/harry-kane.jpeg 860w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/harry-kane-300x174.jpeg 300w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/harry-kane-768x447.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<p>You could do worse than to use one of the planet’s biggest sporting events as a theme and then splice in a narrative about drive and aspiration.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15624" src="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/world-cup-276x300.jpeg" alt="World Cup Russia 2018" width="276" height="300" srcset="https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/world-cup-276x300.jpeg 276w, https://www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/world-cup.jpeg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px" /></p>
<p>And you could do worse than to use a soundtrack that cuts together the type of music that your product will be used to listen to. Well, that’s precisely what Dr Dre has done with the Defiant Mixtape Vol I and the results are a real triumph.</p>
<p><strong>The Guy’s Got Talent</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Guy Richie, the Defiant Mixtape Vol I is World Cup themed and brings together creative film production and viral marketing, then mixes them up with popular culture, sport and the dreams of a young Russian character called Andre.</p>
<p>Besides Andre, the main players in the film include England Captain Harry Kane, Brazil’s Naymar Jr and the French international Benjamin Mendy, each of whom are shown wearing a pair of Beats headphones.</p>
<p>The pace and variety of content is remarkable and these are what drive the film. Richie’s hallmarks, which include whip pans and crash zooms, can be seen throughout and are accompanied by a signature narration, à la Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, adeptly performed by Paul Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>Word Up – There are Cameos</strong></p>
<p>The film also contains cameos from Serena Williams, Patrice Evra and from Thierry Henry, who explains the nature of a “mixtape” and in doing so breaks the fourth wall by addressing the audience directly.</p>
<p>There’s also a short animated section, about Mesut Özil, that tips its hat to the early music videos produced by Snoop Dog and Co &#8211; “do you get the picture?” This is rich media at its most engaging, most effective and as a marketing tool, it drives home its message relentlessly.</p>
<p><strong>The Return on Investment</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the film has been viewed by over 6.5 million YouTube users. Why not be the next?</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGykknw9eCM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Scour any social media channel and the Defiant Mixtape Vol I is there, perform a simple Google search and it’s there. The power of this piece of work is difficult to quantify as it spans so many mediums and works on so many levels.</p>
<p>But let’s face it, Dre isn’t going out of business anytime soon and Beats as a product has and continues to be an amazing success story – so why put so much effort into a film like this? Branding is, of course, the answer. Aligning your product with these type of stars and with a major sporting event is invaluable and for most is something that is simply unattainable.</p>
<p>For Dr Dre, however, the beat goes on, it’s another day at the office and the World Cup audience is watching.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bridging the gap between the academic world and the professional <span id="more-13294"></span>working environment is a big challenge, especially in the field of Filmmaking. Over the past 6 months, we have developed an exciting partnership with <strong><a href="https://www.inholland.nl/" target="_blank">Inholland University</a> </strong>to provide hands-on work experience placements for students on their Media and Entertainment course.</p>
<p>To celebrate the partnership, we recently hosted 30 students and teachers for a three-hour workshop at our base in London.</p>
<p>Following an introduction by River Film managing director, David Groundwater, and a screening of our 2016 reel and latest films, we broke out into groups to give short presentations on our specialisms and field questions from the students. Groups were also given a tour of our office to see the studio in action.</p>
<p>It was a great privilege to welcome to the students and faculty staff from Inholland, and we hope the visit will be the first of many.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wandering through Old Street last week, our Technical Director, Dan Grover, found himself confronted with a familiar sight &#8211; The Bower Old Street. Having completed a <a href="//www.riverfilm.com/work-project/the-bower-old-street/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGI film</a> for the building in 2014, it is rare that we are actually able to physically see the building&#8217;s we make films for. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few westerners visit the infamously secret shores of North Korea, let alone the remote northern regions. However, that is not the case for River Film&#8217;s intrepid traveller and editor, William Long.</p>
<p>After crossing the border from China and travelling to the small city of Rason, William experienced a side of the country that is seldom filmed or reported on by western media. Accompanied by two guides, who were notable for the incredible pride they showed in their country, William and his companions were given a special tour of the city to help them paint an accurate portrait of what life is like in the more rural parts of North Korea.</p>
<p>Farmers, fishermen and factory-workers go about their daily lives with honour and dedication, while locals pitch-in to keep their streets clean and safe. We see the natural beauty of the coastline, the traditions of home life and even a performance by children from a local school.</p>
<p>The film William made, astonishingly shot on his iPhone 5, using the <a href="//www.filmicpro.com/" target="_blank">Filmic Pro</a> app, is exactly the one he set out to make. In his own words, &#8220;the people were beautiful, the scenery was stunning, the colours were vivid and the people we met were genuine characters, loving and full of life &#8211; this is the North Korea that I wanted to show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watch the film here:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Produced for the <strong><a href="//futureofstorytelling.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 Future of Storytelling Summit</a></strong> in New York City, this film sees key speaker and legendary animator <strong><a href="//www.imdb.com/name/nm0443855/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glen Keane</a></strong> test out the latest in virtual reality technology &#8211; <a href="//www.tiltbrush.com/#intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tilt Brush</a> &#8211; a VR tool that allows you to paint the space all around you.</p>
<p>After nearly 40 years at Disney, Keane has been responsible for animating a raft of iconic films, including The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas and Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>Keane&#8217;s passion for his craft is obvious, while his enthusiasm for this new technology highlights how important it will be for the future of animation. After attaching the headset and strapping on the digital brushes, we see him recreate his famous characters in stunning 3D.</p>
<p>As Keane says in the film, &#8220;all the rules have changed.&#8221; While 2D animation is still a valuable and much-loved medium, virtual reality presents &#8220;an entirely new way of thinking for any artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watching this master at work is incredibly inspiring, as he lets his imagination run wild, drawing his characters in life size, his excitement mirroring that of a child seeing film for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean for storytelling?&#8221;, Keane asks. Whatever it is, we here at River Film will be following it very closely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given that we deal in the medium of video, we love to see how brands and individuals use it online. Every month we look at five YouTube channels we think are worth taking a look at, so here&#8217;s our selection for August 2015.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Slow Mo Guys</a></strong></h4>
<p>There is something undeniably satisfying about watching things move in super-slow motion, which is probably why The Slow Mo Guys have racked-up many millions of views. Like any successful YouTube channel, it is all about content here &#8211; from fire breathing to vomiting, machine gun firing to exploding water melons, there is an endless stream of videos to watch and gawp at in high definition.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12379" src="//www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TheSlowMoGuys_YouTube.jpg" alt="The Slow Mo Guys YouTube Channel Top 5" width="300" height="180" /></a></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YesFunnyYes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YesFunnyYes</a></strong></h4>
<p>Juvenile, frat-boy humour at its finest. Committing highly creative (and often dangerous) pranks on unsuspecting victims, we challenge even the most stoney-faced viewer not to laugh at these videos. With well over 1 million subscribers, the YesFunnyYes team have hit on a very popular form of video content.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YesFunnyYes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12380" src="//www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YesFunnyYes_YouTube.jpg" alt="YesFunnyYes YouTube Channel Top 5" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoungTurks/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Young Turks</a></strong></h4>
<p>While they aren&#8217;t quite as all-conquering as Vice, The Young Turks is focussed on covering the news in their own inimitable style and have a huge community of viewers. Edgy yet serious, this is a great alternative news site that provides accessible and informed views on current affairs.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheYoungTurks/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12381" src="//www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/YoungTurks_YouTube.jpg" alt="YoungTurks YouTube Channel Top 5" width="300" height="180" /></a></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDy8zqsb1-0qFZqG689fZ3Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercard</a></strong></h4>
<p>For such a major brand, Mastercard have a surprisingly low subscriber list. However, this number belies the quality of content they produce, which is consistently engaging, diverse and very much focussed on people &#8211; the customer. Their content is also driven by their brand philosophy &#8220;Priceless&#8221;, showing how an integrated brand approach is crucial to modern marketing.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDy8zqsb1-0qFZqG689fZ3Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12382" src="//www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mastercard_YouTube.jpg" alt="Mastercard YouTube Channel Top 5" width="300" height="180" /></a></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dezeenmagazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dezeen</a></strong></h4>
<p>Considering our background of working with architecture, real estate and design, Dezeen is a veritable haven of inspiration and interesting content for us. The London-based magazine produces videos on major events, profiles on key personalities and features on latest trends. For anyone with an interest in architecture and design, this is a channel you must subscribe to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dezeenmagazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12383" src="//www.riverfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dezeen_YouTube.jpg" alt="Dezeen YouTube Channel Top 5" width="300" height="180" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>&#8216;Filmmaking is now available to everyone&#8217; says Zach King, an internet sensation who started out making Final Cut tutorials, before experimenting with <a href="https://youtu.be/NtgtMQwr3Ko">kitten videos</a> on YouTube, and later developing his brand of creativity with <a href="https://vine.co/">Vine</a>.</h2>
<p>His magic six-second Vines take up to 24 hours of preparation and 4 hours of shooting, but his efforts seem to be paying off as now he is starring in commercials for <a href="https://youtu.be/bRE08hkXvfU" target="_blank">LG</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/WT0sLeL4Jso" target="_blank">McDonalds</a>.</p>
<p>We love his work and our production team are impressed by how easy he makes it look, but it&#8217;s even more amazing that seemingly has an endless stream of creative inspiration.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of favourite vines below and see how you could become a Vine star in six seconds!</p>
